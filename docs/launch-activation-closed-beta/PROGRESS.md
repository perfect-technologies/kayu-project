# KAYOU Launch Activation & Closed Beta — Progress

## Status Summary

Created: 2026-07-25

Overall status: **Plan ready; implementation not started**

The public campaign captures provider and “I need a service” client-demand leads together from day one, then operations qualify them and open a controlled beta. Campaign leads do not become Supabase Auth or marketplace accounts. Approved provider leads may be invited after G3; approved client leads may be invited for marketplace access only after G4.

## Current Gates

| Gate | Status | Evidence / blocker |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G0 — Contract frozen | Planning complete | Implementation owners, priority taxonomy IDs, and focus geography still to be assigned |
| G1 — Campaign live | Not started | `02` + campaign portion of `06` |
| G2 — Cohort ready | Not started | Real production lead/qualification counts required |
| G3 — Closed beta open | Not started | Requires G2, production/ops readiness, and recorded GO |
| G4 — Client matching enabled | Not started | Requires 200 counted verified and available home-priority providers after G3 |
| G5 — Cohort review | Not started | Requires real beta evidence |

## Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-07-25 | Create a new phase folder instead of rewriting V1 alignment docs | The activation/beta phase builds on, but does not change, the V1 marketplace contract |
| 2026-07-25 | Campaign submissions are dedicated lead records only | Campaign interest must not create fake or premature marketplace users/providers |
| 2026-07-25 | No Supabase/local account before closed beta opens and an approved lead accepts an invite | Keeps campaign and qualification separate from real identity/account creation |
| 2026-07-25 | Account creation is participant-initiated through real auth | Avoids bulk/pre-created auth accounts and confirms contact ownership |
| 2026-07-25 | Beta opening (G3) precedes provider invitations; provider readiness (G4) precedes client matching | Resolves lifecycle order while protecting supply quality |
| 2026-07-25 | Backend phase and beta membership are authorization boundaries | Public web flags/navigation are not security controls |
| 2026-07-25 | Campaign can proceed before the production Supabase isolation decision | Campaign lead capture does not use Supabase Auth |
| 2026-07-25 | Payments, mobile money, payouts, escrow, complex invoices, quotes, and broad public launch remain excluded | Maintains a focused cash-first controlled beta |
| 2026-07-25 | Campaign is French-first, phone-first, fully responsive, and uses minimal progressively disclosed fields | Most target users arrive on phones and campaign interest should be exceptionally easy to submit |
| 2026-07-25 | Acquisition is judged by completed, valid, contactable, qualified/eligible leads per source | Gives a non-marketing team a practical traction loop and avoids vanity optimization |
| 2026-07-25 | Campaign shows all active existing KAYOU categories; no new home-services umbrella is introduced | Home-related services are an operational priority, not a public taxonomy restriction |
| 2026-07-25 | Home-related existing categories/subcategories receive first priority for recruitment, qualification, invitations, density reporting, and early matching | Establishes the initial operational wedge while preserving all-category lead capture |
| 2026-07-25 | Provider and client-demand forms launch together from G1/day one | Provider readiness gates client marketplace invitation/matching, never demand collection |
| 2026-07-25 | Working G4 client-matching threshold is 200 real, activated, verified, available providers in the home-services priority | This latest working target supersedes the earlier provisional count and does not gate public campaign launch or client-demand intake |

## Open Decisions

These do not block documentation; resolve by the stated gate:

| Decision | Owner | Due |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Resolve the documented home-services priority slugs to reviewed active taxonomy IDs | Product/backend owner | Before G1 |
| Select pilot Kinshasa communes/service areas | Operations owner | Before G1 |
| Confirm remaining numeric defaults other than the fixed working G4 target | Product + operations | Before G1 |
| Name qualification, support, incident, privacy, and release owners | Launch owner | Before G1; backups before G3 |
| Separate production Supabase or explicitly accept/mitigate shared-auth risk | Release/privacy owner | Before first invitation/G3 |
| Confirm privacy/terms versions, withdrawal channel, and retention procedure | Privacy owner | Before G1 |
| Choose support channel/hours | Operations owner | Before G3 |
